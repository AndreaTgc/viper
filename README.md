# Viper chess engine

Viper is a bitboard chess engine written in C.
It's still very much a work in progress so it shouldn't be taken as an example
of what a good chess engine looks like (probably the opposite for now)

## Building the project

In order to build this project simply run the "meson setup build --buildtype=release"
command and then run "ninja -C build"
